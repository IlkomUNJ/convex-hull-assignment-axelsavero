# Identity

Name : Muhammad Axel Savero Fikri

# AI usage

For this assignment, I utilized a generative AI to assist in understanding core concepts, translating pseudocode, and debugging the implementation. The AI model used was Gemini, built by Google.

My interaction with the AI was structured in several phases, reflecting the progression of the assignment. The queries (prompts) I used during each phase are listed below.

Can you explain the concept of a Convex Hull using a simple analogy? I've read the formal definition but would like a more intuitive understanding. 

Based on the SLOWCONVEXHULL pseudocode on page 3 of the PDF, what is the main idea behind the algorithm? Why is it considered slow with O(nÂ³) complexity?

Compare the SLOWCONVEXHULL algorithm with the incremental CONVEXHULL algorithm on page 6 of the PDF. Why is the incremental approach of building an upper and lower hull faster?

What does a 'right turn' mean in the context of the incremental Convex Hull algorithm in the PDF? How do I test for it mathematically using point coordinates?

I'm using Qt Creator. How do I add a custom drawing area (a canvas) to my mainwindow.ui? What widget should I use?

How should I implement the iteration counter inside the loops of the slowConvexHull and fastConvexHull algorithms

My initial implementation of fastConvexHull used Graham Scan, while the PDF uses an incremental algorithm. Are both considered valid fast algorithms? What are their fundamental differences?

Help me adapt my code to match the incremental algorithm in the PDF, specifically the part about constructing the upper and lower hulls separately.

How do I connect a button click from the UI (.ui file) to a C++ function in mainwindow.cpp? For example, for a button named generatePointsButton.

# Collaboration usage

No, i solved this by myself and AI Assistant.

# Commit Rules

Use .gitignore to stripe any binaries from the resulting build before commit. If you cloned directly from the template, you are safe.
